Practicum program final project 
E-Commerce: Product Range Analysis

**Task:**

****Analyze the store's product range.

- Carry out exploratory data analysis
- Analyze the product range
- Formulate and test statistical hypotheses

**Description of the data:**

The dataset contains the transaction history of an online store that sells household goods.

The file `ecommerce_dataset_us.csv` contains the following columns:

`InvoiceNo` — order identifier

`StockCode` — item identifier

`Description` — item name

`Quantity`

`InvoiceDate` — order date

`UnitPrice` — price per item

`CustomerID`


   * Who is our internal customer?
project managers who are responsible for the relevance of the product range

   * Why do they need that?
they want to determine which products are included in the main and additional assortment in order to competently offer additional products to buyers and optimize purchases (there is no point in purchasing a lot of additional products when the main product is not available)
Classifying or categorization can be one of the options for that
